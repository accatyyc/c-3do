# c-3do
A small software renderer in C.

This is a personal project to learn more about computer graphics. The goal: from using only a function to set the color of a single pixel, implement everything needed to render 3D-models.

## Models
c-3do loads models in the [Wavefront .obj-format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file).
